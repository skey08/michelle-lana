                    <p class="text_20-24 padding-bottom_48-64 remove-padding-top">To truly design for everybody, we must think more broadly, reveal bias, and uncover potential areas of exclusion.

With this in mind, we scheduled discussions with other teammates, managers, and staff, especially those not like us, to bring a different perspective to the table.</p>

                    <p class="center">We used a mapping exercise to help spot bottlenecks and identify areas of pain points throughout our customer journey. Even if we only had a one-page site to test, we wanted to fully understand our user's needs when ordering online using screen readers. Mapping out our user's emotions and pain points was instrumental to our efforts.</p>

After I had a look and feel down, I moved over to Adobe XD and created a quick style guide to capture styling elements such as color, typography, buttons, links, icons, and, most importantly, accessibility annotations. Providing a style guide and additional accessibility notes is essential during design-to-dev handoffs.</p>

Never assume that your color combination is good enough. It is always essential to identify the assumptions we have built into any product we design.

I quickly went through the site using keyboard shortcuts. Next, I did the same VoiceOver test on my iPhone, which I believe is easier to do than testing it on the desktop.</p>

                <p class="text_16-20 remove-margin-bottom">As a sighted user, testing the layout of the one-page site was simple enough to understand. But, we wanted to challenge our assumptions, and this is why it was essential to test our product with disabled users to recognize ways that users with disabilities may wish to navigate the web. In hindsight, we should've done an empathy immersion exercise while testing the site using Voiceover. I should've put myself in the shoes of the people with and for whom we are designing, for example: (testing the site on my phone blindfolded or without glasses). This exercise would've opened up more opportunities to understand what goes on under the surface and articulate the needs of what the users we are interviewing are experiencing.</p>

                <p class="text_20-24">Our UX teammate who led the interview had a set of tasks for the participant to perform during the call.

Unfortunately, we did not provide the correct mark-up for the responsive navigation menu, and thus Voiceover did not capture those links during the interview. </p>

                    <p class="text_20-24 padding-bottom_24-48 remove-padding-top">We realized that we still missed a few crucial steps to make our product accessible, even for a simple one-pager site with limited features. We were confident that we had everything figured out, but we, unfortunately, failed to challenge our assumptions and recognize our biases and preferences. It is a great lesson to remember that we are not our users. Therefore, it is vital to include different perspectives and prioritize inclusion at critical points in the design and development process.</p>
